readTumorRegionMRImgFile4NII.m: this is an example copy of code to extract patches from the tumor region from MRI. Note, you have to use the location information.

tumorLocation4T1.txt: tumor location information for the 68 subjects and it is based on T1 MRI. In the code, I have converted them into other imaging space (for example, DTI, freq-fMRI).
